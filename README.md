# openpnp-linear-rails
An [OpenPnP](https://github.com/openpnp) compatible SMT pick and place machine with linear rails based on [Anthony Webb's build](https://hackaday.io/project/9319-diy-pick-and-place).

Project description, build logs, and related files can be found on the [Hackaday.io project page](https://hackaday.io/project/11753-openpnp-linear-rails).

Please note that this is a work-in-progress, and not all design files are released at this time as I want to ensure their correctness and usefulness first.
